# ubuntu-again ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

Because every time you set up Ubuntu, you can't help but think: *"Here we go again..."*

---

## Description

This repo is for those who are tired of installing the same stuff every time they get a fresh Ubuntu machine. It‚Äôs a collection of scripts to automate everything so you can avoid the setup d√©j√† vu.  

From installing Docker to setting up SSH keys, this repo has got your back. Say goodbye to frustration and hello to efficiency (and maybe a little laziness).

---

## Why This Exists
- Setting up Ubuntu is like Groundhog Day: same thing over and over.  
- Nobody likes typing `sudo apt install` for the 50th time.  
- Automation is life, and life is better without setup.  

---

## Features
- Installs essential tools: Docker, Flameshot, JetBrains Toolbox, VS Code, and more.  
- Automates SSH key setup, so you don‚Äôt have to remember how.  
- Configures Docker Compose and Kubernetes because why not?

1. Clone this life-saving repo:

   cd ubuntu-again
   ```
2. Run the magical script:
    ```bash
    chmod +x setup.sh

    ./setup.sh
    ```

3. Sit back, relax, and maybe grab some coffee.
